There is also a step definition cretaed in case if user wants to capture screenshots when needed.




## Services Used:

wdio-image-comparison-service --> for visual regression

docker --> for containerazation


## Installation

Install WebDriverIo_Project with npm

```bash
    cd WebDriverIo_Project
    npm install
```
    
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash

## Step Definitions

below are the generic step definitions created in this framework,

- I open the \"(.*)\" url
- close application
- I set the \"(.*)\" as current page
- I check that \"(.*)\" control is displayed
- I click on \"(.*)\" control
- verify below controls are displayed
- verify below controls contain given href
- I check if \"(.*)\" control contains below text
- Capture screenshot
- I check that \"(.*)\" control is displayed with \"(.*)\"
- I capture the full page for baselining
- I capture \"(.*)\" control screenshot for baselining
- I check the the current page for visual differences
- I check that current page doesnt deviate much from baseline image visually, allowed difference is (\w+)

## Object Repository

UI Objects needed for test automation are stored in a json file under OR folder,

below is the structure followed to add the elements,

{

  "page1Name" : {

    "element1" : "id/css locator/xpath/tag name/link text/...',

    "element2" : "id/css locator/xpath/tag name/link text/...',

  },

  "page2Name" : {

    "element1" : "id/css locator/xpath/tag name/link text/...',

    "element2" : "id/css locator/xpath/tag name/link text/...',

  }
  
}
